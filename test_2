Q1) Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. 
The returned integer should be non-negative as well. You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator. 

Example 1:
Input: x = 4 Output: 2 Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
Example 2:

Input: x = 8 Output: 2 Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
Constraints:
0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

Sol) 
def sqrt(x):
    if x == 0 or x == 1:
        return x

    start = 1
    end = x

    while start <= end:
        mid = start + (end - start) // 2
        if mid*mid > x:  
            end = mid - 1
        else:
            start = mid + 1
    return end
x = 3
print(sqrt(x))
--output will be 1

Q2) You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.


Example 1:

Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4] Output: [7,0,8] Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0] Output: [0]

Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9] Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9 It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

Sol) 
l1 = [2,4,3]
l2 = [5,6,4]
p = ""
q = ""
empty = []
l1.reverse()
l2 .reverse()

for i in l1:
    p+=str(i)
for j in l2:
    q+=str(j)
sum = int(p) + int(q)
sum = str(sum)
y = sum[::-1]
for i in y:
    empty.append(int(i))
print(empty)
--output will be [7,0,8]
